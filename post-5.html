                    <p>During the summer months I used this time to climatize and settle into<br>British culture. Around the corner from my flat I found a branch of my<br>international church and became engaged in regular attendance. Through my<br>religion
                        I was able to develop a sense of peace and belonging. Hurtado and<br>Carter (1997) explain that ‘a sense of belonging is the psychological feeling<br>of belonging or connectedness to a social, spatial, cultural, professional, or<br>other
                        types of group or a community’. <br></p>
                    <p>The cultural diversity of my church provided me also with ability to develop my intercultural communications skills. Intercultural communication is defined as “communication between people from two different cultures” (Chen &amp; Starosta
                        1998:28). <br></p>
                    <p>My church was truly a melting pot of diversity of cultures with members<br>originating from Indian, Africa, Jamaica, Trinidad, Grenada, St. Vincent and<br>the Grenadines, Spain, and Britain. <br></p>
                    <p>Although everyone spoke English either as a first language or second, at<br>times it was difficult to communicate with each other because of cultural<br>misunderstandings brought on our accent, dialect coupled with the speed of<br>speech.
                        It was a struggle for me to understand some of the cultural differences when communicating with my Jamaican church members. <br></p>
                    <p>Although we originate from the same region, we have several cultural<br>differences. I can recall I was invited to lunch after church at a church<br>member’s home who migrated from Jamaica. On entering her home, I proceeded to bend
                        over to remove my shoes at the door, while doing so my host was entering the door at the same time and I bumped my head on the door as she was coming in with her daughter in her hand. She immediately rubbed my head and said ‘hush,
                        hush’ in what sound like an aggressive tone.<br></p>
                    <p>I immediately become annoyed because I though the appropriate response<br>would have been “sorry”. In Barbados when you use the term “hush” you are<br>asking someone to be quiet or what is happening at that time is irrelevant.<br>However,
                        on seeing the look of annoyance on my face she then explained that in Jamaica “hush” mean “sorry”. <br></p>
                    <p>As I reflect on this situation of miscommunication, I realized how one<br>simple word being used within intercultural communication has vastly different meaning which has the power to create a clash in communication. It also caused
                        me to reflect on the importance of understanding how different cultures used words and how these words based on their cultural association can contribute to ineffective communication. <br></p>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote">
                        <p class="mb-0">This is also very important when working with students from different<br>cultures within my language classroom. Understanding how culture affects<br>language is essential within our multicultural language classroom and how this<br>impacts
                            my communication with my students as well.<br></p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>In seeking to communicate effectively with persons<br>from varied cultural backgrounds, I experience issues with communication<br>because of my accent, the speed at which I spoke along with my Barbadian<br>dialect. I found that this
                        became a barrier to my intercultural communication<br>with White British individuals. &nbsp;&nbsp;Across the Caribbean we have varied accents,<br>foods, music, dialects, however one of the things that is very common across<br>all
                        islands is quick speech. McClellan 1981 support this when he refers to<br>Barbadian speech as “machine-gun rapidity of speech”.&nbsp; He goes on to state that can present several problems for persons who are unfamiliar with the
                        speed, accent, and dialect.<br></p>
                    <p>When I am excited about something the speed at which I speak quickens and it makes it very difficult for persons in the British community to understand if they are not familiar with the accent. This not only created problems with my<br>intercultural
                        communication at church but also at work. Students who were<br>mostly White British, would ask me to repeat things several times because they did not understand my accent and the speed at which I was speaking. When I realized this
                        was a problem, I had to adjust not only to the speed of speech but also to my accent. When communicating with persons from a different culture, I had to make a conscious effort to slow my speed of speech and adjust my accent so
                        that understanding of what I am saying is clear. This was important so effective communication could take place through the evidence of feedback. Overtime as I modified my Barbadian accent, I realize that my Barbadian accent was
                        becoming intertwined with a British accent. This blended accent, modified my identity adaptation has created a struggle between my idea of a strong ethnic identity, the adjust and identify with British culture influence and according
                        to Phinney et al 2000 this is referred<br>to as a bicultural identity. I do not wish to give up my ethnic identity<br>however and am still seeking to identify with British culture. <br></p><a href="#"></a>
                    <p>In addition, sometimes, while seeking to engage my students in the learning<br>process, my dialect would make an appearance unexpectedly especially during the first few months of working in London. An example of this would have been
                        while reading a poem to my Year 10 class which was entitled “Storms”.&nbsp; <br></p>
                    <p>While reading the poem, we were discussing the impact that storms have in different parts of the world. I shared an experienced with the class regarding what happened to my grandparent’s ‘backyard’ when the storm was over. I explained
                        that the ‘paling fell down’ because the breadfruit tree broke in half. As I looked at their faces, I realize they were a bit lost. One boy asked ‘backyard?’ and another one asked ‘what is a paling and breadfruit?’ In this instance
                        it was not my accent or speed of speech that was a barrier to their understanding but, it was my dialect. Clarity was brought to the situation and our lesson proceeded. However, that interaction with my class ignite a change in
                        the way I interact with them in the future. It caused me to be more cognizant of my dialect and how it impacted on my interactions with my students.<br></p>
                    <p>As I developed as an individual living in Britain, I realize that adaptability was a must, otherwise I would have lost the identity that has shaped me over the years. Although I am willing to evolve and embrace shifting identity, I
                        was not willing to depart from the essence of who I am. Smaldino, 2019 deposits that shifting between identities assist us to act and respond appropriately, to identify ourselves to the right individual.&nbsp; Clearly, our identity
                        changes based on who we associate with at a given time.&nbsp; <br></p>

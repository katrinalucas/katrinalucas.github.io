                    <p>The rise of King Sugar brought with it many changes to the Caribbean, one of the biggest changes was demographic.&nbsp; The TAST (Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade) meant that a large, enslaved population of West<br>Africans came to our shores
                        making the white British settlers the minority. Though the colonisers ruled with an iron fist, they were never in the majority and ruled through fear.&nbsp; <br></p>
                    <p>Moreover, this fear, has fostered negative interactions between the majority and the minority groups which has created a socially visible fraction entangled in a looming cloud of distrust. <br></p>
                    <p>With Independence, this meant that a black government and black pride and recognition that this was predominantly a country of children of the African Diaspora.&nbsp; In such a historical context as a black Barbadian do not identify
                        with the term ethic minority. <br></p>
                    <p>Hence, in travelling to the land of my colonisers (England), I immediately became subsume under the label it proved difficult to adjust to the label of ethnic minority. <br></p>
                    <p>According to united nations publication, ‘an ethnic<br>minority generally refers to ethnic or racial groups in a given country in which they are in a non-dominant position vis-a’-vis the dominant ethnic population.’<br></p>
                    <p>As a Black Barbadian it is difficult to identify as an ethnic minority coming from a country where I was part of the dominant ethnic population. Within British<br>culture, ethnic minority is associated with negative connotations such
                        as criminal, racial prejudice, stereotype and inequality(Guardian survey, 2018)<br></p>
                    <p>Therefore, the concept of ethnic minority makes me<br>feel segregated from the British Culture with which I and seeking to identity.&nbsp; <br></p>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote">
                        <p class="mb-0">In Barbados, ethnic minority is not a terminology used<br>within my culture to describe the white population even though by definition they would be considered an ethnic minority nor is it of great importance within our culture
                            or institutions. <br></p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>However, in migrating to England at the beginning of<br>the summer in 2005, the importance my ethnicity appears ingrained in all aspect of life and its prominence stood out for me. Whether applying for university or college application
                        evidence of your ethic<br>background is required for all aspects of your life: from applying for a drivers’ license transfer, to an application for college or University, application for<br>jobs and even for a flat.&nbsp; <br></p>
                    <p>Who are these ethnic minorities, does this apply to me? Being identified in a British society as an ethnic minority place me a box, in which, because of my cultural background I felt I did not belong. Jackson (2014) defines this struggle
                        as ascribed identity; this is an identity that is involuntarily given to an individual by others.&nbsp; <br></p><a href="#"></a>
                    <p>My struggles against this ascribed identity have created doubt concerning my own ethnic identity. According to Isajiw 1990 your ‘ethic identity is a social-psychological process which gives an individual a sense of belonging and identity’.
                        At this point in my<br>migrant journey, I am unsure of my ethnic identity.&nbsp; <br></p>
                    <p>Am I who they say I am, or I am who I knew myself to<br>be? Is an ethic identity fixed or is it contextual? As I reflect on these questions, I realize that British culture has created an internal conflict. <br></p>
                    <p>This internal conflict has ignited my rebellious nature and I believe that it has perpetuated stereotypical behaviours towards White British which might have been unwarranted and a barrier to my intercultural communication. <br></p>
                    <p>As when interacting with the White British persons if they seem genuine to ignite a friendship, I am skeptical of their intentions and this created a<br>barrier. This distrust is steam from my cultural interactions with White Barbadians
                        within my own culture where there was not a significant cultural<br>interaction with White Barbadians.<br></p>
                    <p>With time however, the barrier of distrust and skepticism was diminished as I interacted with White British persons from my church and my place of<br>employment. As I immerse myself in the diversity of my environment it changed my
                        perspective of the of White British persons.<br></p>
